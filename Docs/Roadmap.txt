Review pros/cons of adding compression to tables.

DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER Support
Support use cases where a CONTINUE handler is used instead of an EXIT
handler.

Non-DECLARE HANDLER-based Condition Logging
Support use cases where DECLARE HANDLER is not used, but instead
calls are made to GET DIAGNOSTICS NUMBER after statements to
check for various non-fatal conditions, followed by calls to a
logging procedure in this library. This could be useful as well in
cases where non-strict SQL modes are used and the DECLARE HANDLER
doesn't catch SQLWARNING conditions.

Logging Percentage
Add ability to specify % of condition events to log. Implementation
would use a random number generator to select logged events.
