SQL Mode Setting
The SQL mode is set and restored in each individual routine and view file to prevent
undesired behavior when files are modified and run independent of the
library as a whole. This is mainly a development-time fail-safe.

Incorrect Usage Signaling
This library signals when it detects incorrect usage. Before usage
errors are signaled, the session is reset with the exception of
incorrect usage of my_diag_utils.configure_session.

Internal Condition Handling
To reduce condition processing complexity, private procedures do not
implement condition handlers. In fact, none of the my_diag_utils routines
use condition handlers. All internally generated signals are deemed
fatal and indicate bugs, incorrect usage, or instance issues like tables
locked or out of space.

@ehi_my_diag_utils_session_configuring_block_name versus
my_diag_utils.condition_event.flushing_block_name
With proper usage and no nesting of top-level routines, these domains
will always be identical. They were kept distinct from a naming
perspective to make their names match their contextual roles.
