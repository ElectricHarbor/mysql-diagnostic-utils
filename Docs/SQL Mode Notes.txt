This library and the example patterns use the strictest SQL modes
available unless otherwise noted.

TRADITIONAL
    This combination mode is enabled to apply several strict checks.

ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
    This mode is enabled to force proper use of GROUP BY.

IGNORE_SPACE
    This mode is used to enable more flexible routine formatting.

NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO
    This mode is enabled to prevent sloppy use of zero in auto
    increment tables.

NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
    This mode is enabled to ensure ACID compliance. It can be disabled
    on a per-object basis as desired, for example to store tables using
    the MyISAM engine for compression reasons.

    Note: There is possible difference between MySQL and MariaDB on
    this mode being part of TRADITIONAL so it is listed separately.
