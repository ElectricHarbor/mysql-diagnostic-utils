--- Data Domains Tighly Coupled to MySQL/MariaDB ---
GET DIAGNOSTICS NUMBER and my_diag_utils.conditions.condition_value
Data type derived from @@max_error_count range, which is
0 - 65535. The value ranges from 1 to N depending on the value
returned by GET DIAGNOSTICS NUMBER. Docs list data type as INTEGER,
but used SMALLINT UNSIGNED as it covers the currently allowed range.

GET DIAGNOSTICS RETURNED_SQLSTATE and my_diag_utils.conditions.sql_state_code
SQLSTATE is a SQL standards defined CHAR(5).

GET DIAGNOSTICS MYSQL_ERRNO and my_diag_utils.conditions.mysql_error_code
There are conflicting docs on unsigned versus signed for MYSQL_ERRNO.
MySqlErrorCode will likely always be non-negative, but using signed as
fail-safe per obscure comment about negative error codes here:
    https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/perror/

    'If you need to describe a negative error code, use -- before the first error code to end the options.'

GET DIAGNOSTICS MESSAGE_TEXT and my_diag_utils.conditions.message_text
MessageText length is from MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE constant in MySQL source
as of February, 2019.

--- Data Domains Loosely Coupled to MySQL/MariaDB ---
my_diag_utils.call_stacks.reverse_call_stack_level_value
TINYINT UNSIGNED to match max value of @@max_sp_recursion_depth. This is
not an exact domain match, but rather a best guess on how deep MySQL
routine nesting can go. It is 1 based.

*_block_name VARCHAR(194)
schema name VARCHAR(64) + . + table name VARCHAR(64) + . + arbitrary
code block name VARCHAR(64). Block names can be labels or any other
arbitrary name. MySQL labels can be up to 16 characters but using 64 to
give more capacity for non-label use cases. (These notes do not imply
anything about label visibility within a DECLARE HANDLER. See MySQL docs.)

Recommended use for this domain is 'schema_name.routine_name.block_name'
to allow for future views that split *_block_name into schema, routine and
block components for easier filtering.

Not that if dots are used inside of identifier names (e.g. 'my.schema.name'),
the future views that attempt split block names into components will likely
malfunction.
