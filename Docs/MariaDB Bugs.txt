There are MariaDB bugs related to how conditions are resignaled.
These will be referenced in a future commit after additional research is
conducted and MariaDB (and possibly MySQL) teams are notified.

At a high level, the bugs relate to preferential handling of CONDITION 1,
discarding of ER_SP_STACK_TRACE unless RESIGNAL modifies DA (NOP or not),
and partial restoration of DA (only last item) during RESIGNAL when DA was
cleared because of DML in a condition handler.

As a result of these bugs, SHOW WARNINGS does not return accurate
information when used in scripts that call routines using my_diag_utils
for condition processing. Workaround is to rely on the logged data in
the my_diag_utils tables.

MariaDB JSON_OBJECT Bug
MariaDB up to at least 10.3.12, JSON_OBJECT (and other functions) encodes
BIT local variables with the unicode prefix, resulting in invalid JSON
objects. For example, JSON_OBJECT('_my_bit_1', _my_bit_1) with
_my_bit_1 = 1, results in the invalid "{'my_bit_1': \u0001}". Workaround
is to use BOOL/BOOLEAN alias for TINYINT(1) with the understanding it has
valid ranges of 0-9. Another alternative is to cast the BIT to INTEGER
within or before the call to JSON_OBJECT.
