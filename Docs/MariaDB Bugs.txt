There are MariaDB bugs related to how conditions are resignaled.
These will be referenced in a future commit after additional research is
conducted and MariaDB (and possibly MySQL) teams are notified.

At a high level, the bugs relate to preferential handling of CONDITION 1,
discarding of ER_SP_STACK_TRACE unless RESIGNAL modifies DA (NOP or not),
and partial restoration of DA (only last item) during RESIGNAL when DA was
cleared because of DML in a condition handler.

As a result of these bugs, SHOW WARNINGS does not return accurate
information when used in scripts that call routines using my_diag_utils
for condition processing. Workaround is to rely on the logged data in
the my_diag_utils tables.
